					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters. A common use of the BMI is to assess how far an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person's height. The value of a person's BMI may be found also by searching existing tables that show correlation between weight and height, and have separate areas for each category. The BMI is used as a simple measure by doctors to establish some guidelines about how to treat their ppatients. For example, patients assessed as overweight or obese, are at increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or hypertension, among others.</p>

					<h2>How precise is it?</h2>
					<p>The exponent in the denominator the formula is arbitrary. This results in unaccurate results for some individuals. Another limitation is that it takes all weight into account, without considering where most of the weight comes from, fat, bones, or muscle. Because of this, an athlete may be categorized as overweight os obese, while actually having small fat percentages. BMI is more accurate when used to study large samples of individuals, rather than just one person.</p>
